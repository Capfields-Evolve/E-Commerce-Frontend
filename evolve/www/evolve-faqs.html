                <strong>How do I find a product, use cart and checkout?</strong>
                <br> We make it easy to find the items you want and have them delivered right to your door.
                <br>
                <strong>Steps to place an order</strong>
                <br> • Find your item. You can either search for a specific item you’re looking for, or browse by category. You can also visit your order history to buy again directly from your shopping list.
                <br> • Add items to your cart. Spotted something you like? Add it to your cart by tapping or click clicking Add to Cart. You can also adjust the item quantity by using the + or - buttons.
                <br> • Review your cart. You can check what’s in your cart anytime while you’re shopping by clicking or tapping the green Cart button. You’ll see the next available delivery time, as well as the amount needed to reach any order minimums.
                You can also view your item total, adjust quantities, or remove items from your cart.
                <br> • Checkout. When you’re ready to check out, visit your cart and tap or click the green Checkout button. If you have items in your cart from more than one store, you’ll need to choose a delivery window separately for each store. You’ll
                be asked to add a delivery address and your payment information. Then, go ahead and place your order! Your groceries will be on their way in no time.
                <br>
                <strong>What if an item is unavailable?</strong> We go to great lengths to ensure we always find all items in your order. This often necessitates us checking as many as 6 retail outlets before concluding your order. If after checking multiple
                retailers, the item is still unavailable, you will be contacted with suitable substitute to replace item. You are not obliged to accept the replacements and we will only purchase them after receiving a go-ahead from you.
                <br>
                <strong>Can’t find an item?</strong> Not able to find an item you’re looking for in our inventory? Here are a couple things to try.
                <br> USE SEARCH Use the search box in the app or on the website. Sometimes searching for one keyword (for example, searching for “watermelon” instead of “watermelon slices”) can help.  TRY CUSTOM ORDER fill our custom order form and we
                will get exactly what you are looking for Items not available for delivery Please keep in mind that there are some items we aren’t able to deliver or aren’t available at all retailers and markets. In general, our catalog doesn’t include:
                <br> • Non-alcoholic age-restricted products like tobacco and over-the-counter items containing nicotine
                <br> • Items containing pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine
                <br> • Holiday trees
                <br> • Currency
                <br> • Lottery Tickets
                <br> • Gift cards
                <br> Item availability and terms are subject to change without notice. Alcohol is not available at all retailers and markets, and we cannot fulfill special requests for alcohol items.
                <br>
                <strong>Do I pay for delivery if items are unavailable?</strong> While we make every effort to display an accurate list of items that are in stock at the stores we partner with, these stores are ultimately responsible for maintaining their
                inventory levels. In the normal course of a business day, the stores may occasionally run out of some items. You will not be obliged to pay for any unavailable item. If you are not satisfied with the replacement suggested to you by the
                Personal Shopper, we will refund the monetary value of the item to your Capfields Evolve wallet.
                <br>
                <strong>Will you deliver to my area?</strong> We currently serve most parts of Nigeria, although we are not everywhere yet. If your preferred delivery address is not within our current coverage area, you may provide an alternative delivery
                address that is centrally located (perhaps your office or the home of a relative or friend that you visit frequently). However, we would be coming to your area soon and you would be notified when we expand to your area.
                <br>
                <strong>How long does it to get my order delivered?</strong> Same City order is approximately 1 hour 30mins to 2 hours delivery time depending on traffic.<br> Same State order is 2hours to 3hours depending on traffic.<br> Inter State order
                is 24hours to 72hours depending on traffic.<br> Inter Country order is between 15 to 20 working days.
                <br>
                <strong>When will I receive my order?</strong> At checkout, you are able to select a preferred time when you will like your order delivered. We deliver 7 days a week from the time of order to 6pm and can be at your door in as early as
                2 hours after you order.
                <br>
                <strong>How do I pay for my order?</strong> We accept online payments from all major Naira denominated debit and credit cards as well as international Mastercard and Visa cards.We also accept bank tranfers and pay with Evolve wallet. We
                currently do not offer any payment on delivery options.
                <br>
                <strong>What is a Capfields Evolve wallet?</strong> Your Capfields Evolve wallet is your online account where you have monetary value to spend on any product in the platform. We may debit or credit your wallet for various reasons including:
                refunding you for an unavailable item, reconciling the difference between guide and actual price for a weighed item, promotional offers, discounts and rebates.
                <br>
                <strong>How are weighed items priced?</strong> Prices of items that need to be weighed (e.g. fruits, vegetables, deli/cold cuts, meat) may be guide prices or approximated to enable you make a buying decision. However, you will only be
                billed for the actual weight purchased; any difference in guide to actual price will be credited/debited to your Capfields Evolve wallet as the case may be. Actual price of weighed items will be clearly stated on your invoice. Some items,
                such as loose produce, are weighed in stores and markets. Shoppers always try to get the customer’s requested amount of weighted items, but final weights and prices may vary for certain items depending on such factors as product availability
                and seasonality. The final weight and price of items from the deli, meat, and seafood counters are based on the label the retailer applies to those items in-store. If the final weight of the items is different than what was requested,
                your receipt will be adjusted accordingly and you will be charged the accurate price.
                <br>


                <strong>Do images reflect exactly what I will receive?</strong> While most items show actual images of what will be delivered, some images may differ slightly from what is displayed on the website. This may occur for a variety of reasons
                including but not limited to a new/temporary packaging design by the manufacturer, promotional items, same content but different version of an item (e.g. different editions of books or varied book cover design depending on country of print).
                Some images may also be for illustration purposes only and may not exactly reflect the colour, size and shape of actual item; this is particularly relevant for fruits, vegetables and other fresh produce.
                <br>
                <strong>What can I return?</strong> Ans: Please check our return policy for more information.
                <br>
                <strong>Can I cancel my order?</strong> When we receive customer orders, we begin processing them immediately. And because we do not hold our own inventory and we only purchase from stores,fastfoods,markets and pharmacies when customers
                place orders, as soon as customers pay for their orders, we start purchasing their selected products from the stores,pharmacies,fastfoods or markets. The retailers we buy from have a no-return policy so, we in turn, are unable to return
                any items customers purchase from us to the retailers. Thus, once an order has been placed and paid for, evolve.capfields.com.ng is unable to accept a cancellation of the order.
                <br>
                <strong>How can I contact you?</strong> We are always happy to hear from you. If your question has not been covered in our FAQ page, please contact us at help@evolve.capfields.com.ng and we will respond promptly.
